# MicroplasticsModelling
Data used in the journal manuscript 'Description and evaluation of airborne microplastics in the United Kingdom Earth System Model using GLOMAP-mode' is supplied as follows:

Observational Dataset:

The gathered observational data from previous studies can be found in the "observational_studies.csv" file. The titles and authors of these papers can be found within.

Main Figures & Tables:

Figure 1 was created using the "mp_emissions.nc" file.

Figure 2 was created using the "mp_surface_concentrations.nc" file.

Figure 3 was created using the "mp_vertical_concentrations_insoluble.nc" file.

Figure 4 was created using the "mp_vertical_concentrations_soluble.nc" file.

Figure 5 was created using the "observation_model_active.csv" file for subplots (a) and (c), and the "observation_model_deposition.csv" file for subplots (b) and (d). The "ocean_mask.npy" and "land_mask.npy" files were used to generate the ocean/land mask. 

Table 2 was created using the averages from the "mp_mass_concentration_insoluble.nc", "mp_number_concentration_insoluble.nc", "mp_mass_number_concentration_soluble.nc" and "mp_fibres_concentration.nc" files, also used to plot Appendix Figures 2 - 5.

Table 3 was created using the "MP_Global_Budget.csv" and "MP_Global_Budget_Fractions.csv" files. 

Table 4 was created using the "mp_total_aerosol_concentrations.nc" file.

Appendix Figures & Tables:

Appendix Figure 1 was created using the "mp_extrapolate.nc" file.

Appendix Figures 2 - 5 were created using the files "mp_mass_concentration_insoluble.nc", "mp_number_concentration_insoluble.nc", "mp_mass_number_concentration_soluble.nc" and "mp_fibres_concentration.nc" files respectively.

Appendix Figure 6 was created using the "AOD_CCN_CDNC.nc" file.

Appendix Table 1 was created using the "MP_Global_Budget_Ocean_Land.csv" and "MP_Global_Budget_Ocean_Land_Percent.csv" files
